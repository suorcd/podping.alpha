# Podping.alpha

( **This documentation is incomplete** )

Podping.cloud is the hosted front-end to the [Podping](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping) notification 
system.  It stands in front of the back-end writer(s) to provide a more friendly HTTP based API.

This alpha version is a work in progress.  It is currently in an exploration phase.  The goal of this
version is to wireframe the p2p gossip writer and corresponding front-end support.

## Testing
At this point on the development just running the `gossip-listener` will help with the testing.

Setting `ARCHIVE_ENABLED` to `1`, `yes` or `true` could be a second step, but this could fill up your hard disk.

Check the [gossip-listener documentation](gossip-listener/README.md) for all the info.

### Quick set-up
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping.alpha.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
cd gossip-listener
cargo build
NODE_FRIENDLY_NAME='IDENTIFICADOR_AMIGABLE' cargo run
```
### Update
- Go to the `podping.alpha` directory.
- Run `git pull`, discard or merge any local changes.
- Same as the [Quick set-up](#quick-set-up) without the `git clone ...`.

#### Dependencies
You need `rust` in order to run/compile this tool.
- In [ArchLinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Rust) you can just install `rust` or `rustup` (recommended if you intend to do development) with : `pacman -S rust`
- In [debian](https://wiki.debian.org/Rust) install `build-essential` AND `cargo` or `rustup`. Execute `rustup default stable` if you choose `rustup`.

### Configuration
* You can change these ENV [variables](gossip-listener#configuration):
  * `ZMQ_BIND_ADDR`
  * `IROH_SECRET_FILE`
  * `ARCHIVE_PATH`
  * `AUTO_TRUST_ENDORSEMENTS`
  * `ARCHIVE_ENABLED` - Stores all the podpings from the topic in a SQLite database. If another listener has been offline and wants to "catch up" it can start with `CATCHUP_ENABLED=true` and it will search the swarm for an `ARCHIVE_ENABLED=true` listener to back-fill from.

### Known Issues
* `gossip-listener` uses the port `6881` so you might get a warning if there is already running a Bitorrent tracker like ktorrent.

## Overview

There are two main components of a podping.cloud node.  The first is a web HTTP front-end just called `podping` that 
accepts GET requests like so:

```http
GET https://podping.cloud/?url=https://feeds.example.org/podcast/rss
```

You can also append 2 additional parameters (`reason` and/or `medium`):

```http
GET https://podping.cloud/?url=https://feeds.example.org/livestream/rss&reason=live&medium=music
```

If `reason` is not present, the default is "update".  If `medium` is not present, the default is "podcast".  A full
explanation of these options and what they mean  
is [here](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping-hivewriter#podping-reasons).

The next component is one or more back-end writers that connect to the front-end over a ZMQ socket.  There are two writers:

* The [hive-writer](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping-hivewriter), a python script that 
listens on localhost port `9999` for incoming events.  When it receives an event, it attempts to write that event as 
a custom JSON notification message to the Hive blockchain.
* The gossip-writer, a rust binary that listens on localhost port `9998` for incoming events.  When it receives an event, 
it attempts to write that event as a message to a gossip topic using Iroh to broadcast it to the network.

<br>

## Requests

The front-end accepts GET requests and does a few things:

1. Ensures that the sending publisher has included a valid 'Authorization' header token.
2. Validates that the token exists in the `auth.db` sqlite db.
3. Validates that the format of the given podcast feed url looks sane
4. Saves the url into the `queue.db` sqlite database in the `queue` table.
5. Returns `200` to the sending publisher.

A separate thread runs in a loop as a queue checker and does the following:

1. Checks the `queue.db` database and fetches up to 1000 feeds at a time in FIFO order ("live" reason is prioritized).
2. Checks the ZEROMQ tcp socket to the `hive-writer` listener on port `9999`.
3. Construct one or more `Ping` objects in protocol buffers to send over the socket to the writer(s).
4. Sends the `Ping` objects to `hive-writer` socket for processing and waits for success or error to be returned.
5. If success is returned from the writer, the url is removed from `queue.db`.
6. If an error is returned or an exception is raised, another attempt is made after 180 seconds.

There is a dummy auth token in the `auth.db` that is ready to use for testing.  The token value is:

<br>

```text
Blahblah^^12345678
```

In order to avoid running as a root user, please set the `PODPING_RUNAS_USER` environment variable to the non-root 
user you want the front-end executable to run as.  Something like this:

```bash
PODPING_RUNAS_USER="podping" ./target/release/podping
```

## Back-end Writers

 - [Podping-hivewriter](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping-hivewriter):  Accepts events from the podping.cloud
                        front-end or from the command line and writes them to the Hive blockchain.
 - Under construction: Accepts events from the podping.cloud
                        front-end or from the command line and writes them to a gossip topic using Iroh.

## Running a Full Podping.cloud Node

The best way to run a podping.cloud node is with docker compose.  There is a [docker] folder for this.  Just clone this
repo, switch to the `docker` folder and issue `docker compose up`.  It is expected that the database files will live in
a directory called `/data`.  If this directory doesn't exist, you will need to create it.

Initially, the `auth.db` and `queue.db` will be blank.  You will need to populate the "publishers" table in the
`auth.db` file to have a funcional system.  See the example files in the `databases` directory in this repo for an 
example of the format for publisher token records.
