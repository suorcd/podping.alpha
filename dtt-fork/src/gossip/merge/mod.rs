//! Peer merging strategies for recovering from network partitions.
//!
//! Two complementary strategies detect and heal split-brain scenarios:
//! - **Bubble Merge**: Joins small clusters (< 4 peers) with peers advertised in DHT
//! - **Message Overlap**: Detects when isolated clusters share common message hashes,
//!   indicating they have seen the same messages and can be merged
